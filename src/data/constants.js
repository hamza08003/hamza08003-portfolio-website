    description:
      "Developed an advanced voice assistant that processes voice commands to execute tasks like launching applications, performing web searches, and retrieving real-time data. Voice recognition enabled accurate input capture, while text-to-speech processing delivered clear responses, enhancing user interaction design. System automation facilitated opening tools such as calculators, cameras, and text editors, and web interaction supported searches on Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia, alongside fetching weather updates and trending movies. Natural language processing and command parsing interpreted diverse commands, enabling email and WhatsApp messaging, plus AI-generated answers via OpenAI integration. Error handling ensured reliable operation, managing unrecognized inputs effectively.",

    description:
      "Developed DeepCrawl Vision, a versatile pipeline for deep website crawling and advanced image analysis. It recursively scrapes websites to extract data like page URLs and image URLs etc enabling applications such as content analysis and data mining. The system asynchronously downloads images with rate-limited precision, organizes them by crawl depth, and deduplicates using perceptual hashing to retain top-quality versions. DeepFace powers face detection using RetinaFace and ArcFace for face vector embedding extraction, with results stored in structured CSVs. Featuring GPU-accelerated batch processing and detailed Excel outputs, this project excels in scalable web scraping, image processing, and machine learning, adaptable for facial recognition, data mining, and more.",

    title: "Dual Audio Capture Tool",
    date: "Nov 2024 - Dev 2024",
    description:
      "A real-time audio monitoring tool built in Python that simultaneously captures and analyzes audio from both a microphone and system loopback device using the pyaudiowpatch library. It intelligently detects the current active audio source—whether it's microphone input, system audio, or silence—by calculating the Root Mean Square (RMS) energy of audio frames. The tool dynamically switches its output based on detected audio activity and prints the current source accordingly. Designed with performance in mind, the system uses buffered audio reads, silence detection thresholds, and CPU load minimization strategies like timed sleeps. It leverages NumPy for efficient signal processing and supports configurable channel types (mono/stereo) and sample rates. This tool is useful for tasks like live monitoring, audio switching automation, and building intelligent voice-aware systems.",
